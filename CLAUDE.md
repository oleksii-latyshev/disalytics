## What this is

**disalytics** — a fully client-side web app for analyzing Counter-Strike 2 match replays (`.dem`),
installable as a PWA, in English and Russian. It compresses a 40-minute match into a ~10-minute
review via filtering, an interactive timeline, and a 2D radar.

The name is game-agnostic on purpose. Nothing outside `crates/demo-parser` may encode "CS2" as an
assumption.

**Product principle:** a tool for *review*, not frame-perfect replay. Where accuracy and interaction
smoothness conflict, favour smoothness and label the approximation in the UI.

---

## Repository state

Phase 0 is complete — the parser is validated and the findings are in `docs/PARSER.md`. The
`create-turbo` starter has been replaced: `apps/web` is a Vite SPA, Biome has replaced
ESLint + Prettier, and every package is `@disa/*`.

Phase 1 is in progress, so `AGENTS.md` §4 still describes packages that do not exist yet —
`demo-core`, `demo-parser`, `demo-store`, `map-data`, `i18n`, and everything under `crates/`. Their
absence is a schedule fact, not a contradiction.

**`AGENTS.md` outranks anything you observe in the file tree.** If existing code contradicts the
docs, the code is the thing that is wrong.

---

## Hard rules — violating one is a bug, not a trade-off

Full text in `AGENTS.md` §2. Condensed:

1. **No server ever touches a `.dem` file.** No uploads, no demo bytes in any network request.
2. **Parsing runs in a Web Worker.** The main thread never opens, decompresses, or parses a demo.
3. **Per-tick data lives in typed arrays (columnar/SoA), never arrays of objects.** Events are the
   opposite — plain sorted arrays of objects, binary-searched by tick.
4. **`clock.frame` never lives in React state, Zustand, or signals.** Plain mutable object + rAF.
5. **No `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` for parsed data.** OPFS first, IndexedDB fallback.
   UI preferences (locale, theme) are fine there.
6. **No `any`.** No `@ts-expect-error` without a comment and a linked issue. No `!`, no silencing
   `as`.
7. **No hardcoded user-facing strings.** Everything through i18n, `en` *and* `ru` together.
   `demo-core` and the parser emit `{ key, params }`, never display text.
8. **Parsing is deterministic.** Same bytes + same `SCHEMA_VERSION` → byte-identical output.
9. **No animation on the main thread during playback.** `transform`/`opacity` only.
10. **New runtime dependencies require human approval.** Bundle size is a product constraint.
11. **`packages/demo-core` stays platform-agnostic** — no DOM, no React, no I/O, no `@/` alias.
12. **`crates/demo-parser` contains no `wasm-bindgen`**, `js-sys`, or `web-sys`. That is what keeps
    a native Tauri build possible.
13. **Dependency direction is one-way** — `features → core → shared`, `apps → packages`. Never
    sideways between features, never upward. Import barrels, never deep paths.

## Conventions that get broken most often

- **`tick` and `frame` are different things.** `tick` is a demo tick at the demo's tick rate;
  `frame` is a sample index in `TickTrack` at `sampleHz`. A variable named `tick` holding a frame
  index is a bug even when the code works.
- **Game vocabulary is never translated.** Weapon names, map names, callouts, and domain shorthand
  (`AK-47`, `Mirage`, `Mid`, `eco`, `clutch`) are canonical constants in `demo-core`, not i18n keys.
  UI chrome, help text, and errors *are* translated.
- **Russian plurals need four ICU forms** (`one`/`few`/`many`/`other`). Two forms is a broken `ru`.
- **Layouts are designed against the Russian string**, which runs 15–30% longer. No fixed-width
  labels.
- **All numbers use tabular figures**, IBM Plex Mono, `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.
- **Aim for zero comments.** A comment is justified only for a constraint the code cannot express —
  engine constants, bit layouts, the WASM boundary, platform workarounds, deliberate perf choices.
- **No `TODO` comments.** Open an issue instead.
- **Package names are `@disa/<folder>`**, and the folder name always matches.

## Workflow

`issue → branch (gh issue develop) → commits → PR (Closes #N) → CI green → squash merge`

**No issue, no branch.** Never push to `main`. One PR per issue. Squash merge only. Conventional
commit titles, scope = the `area:` label without its prefix.

Use the `task` skill for the full loop, `i18n-key` when adding a user-facing string, and `dod`
before opening a PR.

---

## Commands

```bash
bun install
bun run dev            # vite dev server for apps/web
bun run build          # tsc --noEmit && vite build -> apps/web/dist
bun run typecheck
bun run check          # biome — lint + format (check:fix to apply)
```

Still to arrive: `test` (Vitest), `i18n:check`, `size`, `wasm:build`, `mapdata:generate`,
`preview`, and `cargo test -p demo-parser`. See `AGENTS.md` §5 for the full intended set.

## Stop and ask instead of guessing

If a task would add a runtime dependency, introduce async I/O into a scrub or render path, change
`SCHEMA_VERSION`, require server-side anything, exceed a budget in `AGENTS.md` §16, move
`clock.frame` into a reactive store, animate during playback, add `wasm-bindgen` to
`crates/demo-parser`, hardcode a user-facing string, or translate game vocabulary — ask.

These are the decisions the documentation exists to protect.
